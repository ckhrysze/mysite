<p>I was modifying a setup script at work when I came across an environment variable not set by the
  script, or anywhere else in the project. Tracing back, the original code to set the variable relied
  on <span class="highlight">find</span> from the current user's home directory, and was therefore not
  scaling well. The commit suggested moving it to any of the other places one might set environment
  variables (for example, <a href="/blog/direnv/">Direnv</a>).</p>

<p>However, there was nothing ensuring that variable existed. Seeing a good opportunity to make things
  clearer for the next developer to come along, I went to Stack Overflow (well, Google, but clicked the
  first Stack Overflow result). Not only did I find
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/307735/9276">an answer</a>, but a very thorough explaination.</p>

<p>This gist is just a quick example to remind myself how this technique works.</p>
