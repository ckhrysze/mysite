<p>Despite hearing about it from afar for a while, I've yet to really dig into <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" >elm.</a> I listened to a few <a href="https://changelog.com/191/">Changelog</a> <a href="https://changelog.com/218/">podcasts</a>, read through the documentation and even installed it at one point, but never had the chance to really sit down and learn what its all about</p>

<p>I recently watched <a href="http://jessitron.com/">Jessica Kerr's</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/cgXhMc8M4X4">GOTO; talk about elm</a> which renewed my excitement, especially as her talk made it feel even more approachable.</p>

<p>Even better, this time I have an actual project I would like to do, and elm seems like an ideal fit for my goals.</p>
