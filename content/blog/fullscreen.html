<p>My editor of choice is Emacs. I admit I've been impressed with VSCode, and currently use it for editing .vue files. I'll also use it for breakpoint enabled debugging when working with some languages. However, I don't foresee a sharp decline in my Emacs usage anytime soon, and therefore I'll sporadically step back and see if there are things to make my use even better.</p>

<p>Tonight, I was working on my elixir-mode and alchemist usage and config, and was restarting Emacs frequently. At some point I became frustrated by having to maximize the window (frame, technically) each time. <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2999/how-to-maximize-my-emacs-frame-on-start-up">Stack Exchange</a> to the rescue! I learned two things from that page. First, on my machine at least (Ubuntu 16.04) <span class="fa-border">ctrl</span>+<span class="fa fa-windows fa-border"></span>+<span class="fa fa-arrow-up fa-border"></span> will make any window full screen.</p>

<p>Second, for Emacs, I added <span style="font-family: monospace">(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))</span> to my <a href="https://github.com/ckhrysze/emacsd">Emacs config</a>.</p>
