<p>About a month ago I started a new job. My first real task? Update a manual document generation process with automatic PDF creation. Apparently knowing PDF frameworks and also not hating PDF is a rare combination. The stack is mostly python, but the team is small and flexible, so had no issue with my using <a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn">Prawn</a>.</p>

<p>During the job hunt I had no free time, and getting up to speed this last month has left me too mentally drained most evenings to work on side projects. However, the one I have spent more than zero time on has been a school (mostly math) worksheet generation thing. As I do with side projects, I'm also using it to try new things, and the big new thing will likely be <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or some other front end tech. However, with the help of <a href="https://medium.com/@Stephanbv/ruby-code-in-elixir-project-97614a9543d">this blog post</a> (which also ends up with Prawn) the server side already has a phoenix project that uses Prawn to generate the worksheets.</p>
